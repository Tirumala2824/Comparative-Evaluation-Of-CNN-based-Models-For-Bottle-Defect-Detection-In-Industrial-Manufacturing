# Comparative-Evaluation-Of-CNN-based-Models-For-Bottle-Defect-Detection-In-Industrial-Manufacturing


This repository contains Python code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to detect faults in bottle images. The model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras, and it utilizes image data stored in the 'images' directory.

## Overview

The code includes functions to:
- Load images and labels from subfolders within the specified directory
- Preprocess the images and labels for model training
- Create and compile a CNN model architecture using TensorFlow and Keras
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
- Train the model and evaluate its performance

## Usage

### Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set the `root_directory` variable to the path where the image dataset is stored.
3. Run the Python script to execute the CNN model for bottle fault detection.

## Additional Notes

This project aims to showcase a basic implementation of a CNN model for fault detection in bottle images. Feel free to modify and expand upon the code to suit your requirements.
